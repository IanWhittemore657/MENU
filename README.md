MENU is a restaurant idea where users are able to select their foods and then see what the nutrients are of each item.

This application is using local storage data for the list of items and objects, however it would be very easy to integrate firebase so that someone else can easily upload different foods without needing to update the mobile application.

This is a great example of what could be used for other things besides food such as clothing or other items.

The application also demonstrates how it will calculate the price based on the quantity and will add it into a cart

Another feature is the cards that list the nutrients for each food item and when a user selects a card it will not only change colour of the background but the font colour too. I mentioned in the comments of the code that this could be expanded on by having more information about each card , for example showing what types of fats are in the food.

Please look at the comments of the code to see what each function does and how it was made and other future expansions that could be had.

Thank you
